# Kairen
The secret language you already know. 

**TLDR**
1. Multisyllable:
    1. Put right half in front of left half, right half always 1 more syllable in odd number syllable words.
        1. explore -> eks plor -> ploreks
        2. avalon -> a va lan -> valana
        3. performance -> per for mans -> formansper
        4. formula -> for myu la -> myulafor
        5. veronica -> ve ro ni ka -> nikavero
    
2. Monosyllable:
    1. Ends in a consonant
        1. Add a vowel at the end to make it a two syllable word, then switch the two syllables (as if it's a regular two syllable word)
        2. Plosive consonants get an "o"
            1. ko, go, po, bo, to, do, cho, jo
            2. bike -> bai ko -> kobai
            3. bitch -> bi cho -> chobi
            4. dot -> da to -> toda    
            5. cat -> ka to -> toka
        3. Fricative consonants get a "u"
            1. su, vu, fu, vu, shu, zhu, thu, dhu, hu
            2. barf -> bar fu -> fubar
            3. trash -> tra shu -> shutra
            4. have -> ha vu -> vuha
            5. math -> ma thu -> thuma
        4. Resonating consonants get a "e"
            1. re, le, me, ne
            2. car -> ka re -> reka
            3. bell -> be le -> lebe
            4. dam -> da me -> meda
            5. can -> ka ne -> neka
    2. Ends in a vowel
        1. Switch the vowel and consonant
            1. to -> t u -> ut
            2. lie -> l ai -> ail
            3. the -> dh a -> adh
        2. If the consonant or consonant blend is unpronounceable once moved to the end, you add an "e" to the end.
            1. blue -> blu -> ubl -> uble
            2. draw -> dra -> adr -> adre
            3. how -> hau -> auh -> auhe
3. VC Words
    1. If the word is a vowel/diphthong (vowel blend) and then a single consonant sound, you just switch the two.
        1. on -> a n -> na (as opposed to a ne -> nea)
        2. ate -> ei t -> tei (as opposed to ei to -> toei)
        3. in -> i n -> ni (as opposed to i ne -> nei)
4. Set Words
    1. I (ai) = Ki
    2. You (yu -> uy) = Ku
    3. We (we -> iw) = Ke
    4. Eye (ai) = Ao

Words are created from English, and there is an easy rule for multisyllabic words, and an easy rule for monosyllabic words.

## 2+ Syllable Words

### Even Number Syllables

Words are created by taking the right half of syllables and putting them in front of the left half of syllables. This is done with the transliteration of the word; a.k.a. the phonetic inscription of the word.

- respect -> ri spekt -> spektri
- commit -> ka mit -> mitka
- request -> re kwest -> kwestre

### Odd Number Syllables

Crucially, if the word has an odd number of syllables, the right half takes the extra syllable in the middle (split 1/2). This is because many suffixes in English are one syllable long.

Suppose we did the opposite of this and said that the left half takes the extra syllable in the middle (2/1). 

- beautiful -> byu ti fal -> falbyuti
- government -> ga vern ment -> mentgavern

Because the root word stays together, the resulting transformed word sounds a lot like it used to. For this reason we have the right half take the extra syllable in the middle (1/2).

- beautiful -> byu ti fal -> tifalbyu
- government -> ga vern ment -> vernmentga

For 4 syllable words, the split is just 2/2 as is usual for any even-number-of-syllables word.

- monopoly -> ma na po li -> polimana
- security -> se kyu ri ti -> ritisekyu

## 1 Syllable Words

For monosyllabic words, we fall into two categories, those that end in a consonant, and those that don't.

### End in Consonant
(CVC, VC Words (where C = consonant, V = vowel))

For those that end in a consonant, we add a vowel to the end to make it a **two** syllable word, and then switch the two syllables as is usual.

- gas -> ga su -> suga
- smith -> smi thu -> thusmi

The vowel depends on which consonant is the final consonant.

1. For final plosive consonants, use "o". These consonants are k, g, p, b, t, d, ch, j (counting affricates here)
    1. ko, go, po, bo, to, do, cho, jo
    2. bike -> bai ko -> kobai
    3. bitch -> bi cho -> chobi
    4. dot -> da to -> toda    
    5. cat -> ka to -> toka

2. For final fricative consonants, use "u". These consonants are s, z, f, v, sh, zh, h, unvoiced th, voiced th (here we use "dh").
    1. su, zu, fu, vu, shu, zhu, hu, thu, dhu
    2. barf -> bar fu -> fubar
    3. trash -> tra shu -> shutra
    4. have -> ha vu -> vuha
    5. math -> ma thu -> thuma
    
3. For final resonating consonants, use "e". These consonants are r, l, m, n.
    1. re, le, me, ne
    2. car -> ka re -> reka
    3. bell -> be le -> lebe
    4. dam -> da me -> meda
    5. can -> ka ne -> neka

I could have used "u" for everything, regardless of which consonant it is, but it resulted it way too many "u"s around everywhere. So I made it depend on which consonant it is so that there are more vowels in use. However, technically speaking, using "u" with everything would still work.

### End in Vowel
(CV, CCV Words)

For monosyllabic words that end in a vowel, you switch the consonant or consonant blend in the beginning with the vowel at the end.

- to -> t u -> ut
- lie -> l ai -> ail
- the -> dh a -> adh

If the consonant or consonant blend is unpronounceable once moved to the end, you add an "e" to the end.

- blue -> blu -> ubl -> uble
- draw -> dra -> adr -> adre
- how -> hau -> auh -> auhe

### Exceptions
#### VC Words
To keep some commonly used words short, if the word is a vowel/diphthong (vowel blend) and then a single consonant sound, you just switch the two.

- on -> a n -> na (as opposed to a ne -> nea)
- ate -> ei t -> tei (as opposed to ei to -> toei)
- in -> i n -> ni (as opposed to i ne -> nei)

#### Set Words
Some words are unaffected by the algorithm because they are only vowels, or their resultant word doesn't sound super nice. We make a set vocabulary word for these.

- I (ai) = Ki
- You (yu -> uy) = Ku
- We (we -> iw) = Ke
- Eye (ai) = Ao


## Example Sentences

1

- How are you?
- **Auhe ra ku?**
- I'm good, how are you?
- **Mai dogu, auhe ra ku?**
- I'm fine, just a little sleepy.
- **Mai nefai, tojas telli pisli.**

2

- I have so much work.
- **Ki vuha os chomu kowor.**
- Then why don't you come get coffee with me?
- **Nuthe aiwe todon ku muka toge feka thuwi im?**
- Ok sounds good!
- **Ko dosaunz dogu!**

3

- Thanks for everything.
- **Kotheinz refo rithingeve.**
- You're welcome.
- **Reyu kamwel.**

Let's be honest, this language is mostly useful for shittalking people without them noticing, so you might as well prioritize learning some of that.

1

- That bitch is very rude.
- **Totha chobi zi rive doru.**

2

- He looks like a pig.
- **Ihe kuluz kolai gopi.**

3

- Smack that hoe.
- **Kosma totha ohe.**


## Orthography

To make this complete Kairen, you can spell the words with the Kairen orthography, which is English but with some changes.

- c = /sh/
    - tc = /ch/ (because /ch/ = /t/ + /sh/)
- j = /zh/
    - dj = /j/ (because /j/ = /d/ + /zh/)
- x = /ng/
- q = /th/ (both voiceless and voiced)

This removes all digraphs from the language, a.k.a. one consonant = one consonant sound, no more two consonants mapping to one sound.

- smith -> smi qu -> qusmi
- this -> qi su -> suqi
- language -> leix gwidj -> gwidjleix
- measure -> me jer -> jerme
- choose -> tcu zu -> zutcu
- shelf -> cel fu -> fucel

Technically optional, but improves the language quite a bit.

## Grammar

We make some grammar changes to make it easier to speak. This constitutes either making sentences shorter, or making it easy to turn a sentence into a question without reordering, etc.

1. Remove all useless-ish words
    1. Articles not required, "the"/"a" not required
        1. Pet the dog
        2. Tope adh goda
        3. Tope goda (Pet dog)
        4. --
        5. Do you have a pen?
        6. Ud ku vuha a nepe?
        7. Ud ku vuha nepe? (Ku vuha nepe ne? (#3))
    2. "To" is not required if the verb only has 1 object argument.
        1. I am going to the store
        2. Ki ma inggo ut adh resto
        3. Ki ma inggo resto (I am going store)
    4. Drop "is"/"are"/"am" (copula dropping)
        1. You are too loud
        2. Ku ra ut dolau
        3. Ku ut dolau
2. Verbs are implied present continuous tense
    1. I am going to the store
    2. Ki ma inggo resto
    3. Ki og resto (I go store)
3. Add "ne" to end of sentence to indicate yes/no question
    1. Do you want to go with me to the movie?
    2. Ud ku towan ut og thuwi im ut adh vimu?
    3. versus
    4. You want go with me movie ne?
    5. Ku towan og thuwi im vimu ne? (Ku towan og thuwi **ki** vimu ne?)
4. Can use subject personal pronoun in object case.
    1. I hate him
    2. I hate he
    3. Ki tohei ihe
    4. --
    5. Go with me
    6. Go with I
    7. Og thuwi ki
7.
