The secret language you already know. 

**TLDR**
1. Multisyllable:

    a. Put right half in front of left half, right half always 1 more syllable in odd number syllable words
  
        i. explore -> eks plor -> ploreks
        
        ii. avalon -> a va lan -> valana
        
        iii. veronica -> ve ro ni ka -> nikavero
    
  b. 


Words are created from English, and there is an easy rule for multisyllabic words, and an easy rule for monosyllabic words.

## 2+ Syllable Words

### Even Number Syllables

Words are created by taking the right half of syllables and putting them in front of the left half of syllables. This is done with the transliteration of the word; a.k.a. the phonetic inscription of the word.

respect -> ri spekt -> spektri

commit -> ka mit -> mitka

request -> re kwest -> kwestre

### Odd Number Syllables

Crucially, if the word has an odd number of syllables, the right half takes the extra syllable in the middle (split 1/2). This is because many suffixes in English are one syllable long.

Suppose we did the opposite of this and said that the left half takes the extra syllable in the middle (2/1). 

beautiful -> byu ti fal -> falbyuti

government -> ga vern ment -> mentgavern

Because the root word stays together, the resulting transformed word sounds a lot like it used to. For this reason we have the right half take the extra syllable in the middle (1/2).

beautiful -> byu ti fal -> tifalbyu

government -> ga vern ment -> vernmentga

For 4 syllable words, the split is just 2/2 as is usual for any even-number-of-syllables word.

monopoly -> ma na po li -> polimana

security -> se kyu ri ti -> ritisekyu

## 1 Syllable Words

For monosyllabic words, we fall into two categories, those that end in a consonant, and those that don't.

### End in Consonant
(CVC, VC Words (where C = consonant, V = vowel))

For those that end in a consonant, we add a vowel to the end to make it a **two** syllable word, and then switch the two syllables as is usual.

gas -> ga su -> suga

smith -> smi thu -> thusmi

The vowel depends on which consonant is the final consonant.

1. For final plosive consonants, use "o". These consonants are k, g, p, b, t, d, ch, j (counting affricates here)
    
    a. ko, go, po, bo, to, do, cho, jo
    
    b. bike -> bai ko -> kobai
    
    c. bitch -> bi cho -> chobi
    
    d. dot -> da to -> toda
    
    e. cat -> ka to -> toka
2. For final fricative consonants, use "u". These consonants are s, z, f, v, sh, zh, h, unvoiced th, voiced th (here we use "dh").
    
    a. su, zu, fu, vu, shu, zhu, hu, thu, dhu
    
    b. barf -> bar fu -> fubar
    
    c. trash -> tra shu -> shutra
    
    d. have -> ha vu -> vuha
    
    e. math -> ma thu -> thuma
    
3. For final resonating consonants, use "e". These consonants are r, l, m, n.
    
    a. re, le, me, ne
    
    b. car -> ka re -> reka
    
    c. bell -> be le -> lebe
    
    d. dam -> da me -> meda
    
    e. can -> ka ne -> neka

I could have used "u" for everything, regardless of which consonant it is, but it resulted it way too many "u"s around everywhere. So I made it depend on which consonant it is so that there are more vowels in use. However, technically speaking, using "u" with everything would still work.

### End in Vowel
(CV, CCV Words)

For monosyllabic words that end in a vowel, you switch the consonant or consonant blend in the beginning with the vowel at the end.

to -> t u -> ut

lie -> l ai -> ail

the -> dh a -> adh

If the consonant or consonant blend is unpronounceable once moved to the end, you add an "e" to the end.

blue -> blu -> ubl -> uble

draw -> dra -> adr -> adre

how -> hau -> auh -> auhe

### Exceptions
#### VC Words
To keep some commonly used words short, if the word is a vowel/diphthong (vowel blend) and then a single consonant sound, you just switch the two

on -> a n -> na (as opposed to a ne -> nea)

ate -> ei t -> tei (as opposed to ei to -> toei)

in -> i n -> ni (as opposed to i ne -> nei)

#### Set Words
Some words are unaffected by the algorithm because they are only vowels, or their resultant word doesn't sound super nice. We make a set vocabulary word for these.

I (ai) = Ki

You (yu -> uy) = Ku

We (we -> iw) = Ke

Eye (ai) = Ao
