The secret language you already know. 

Words are formed by switching syllable 1 with syllable 2, syllable 3 with syllable 4, and so on. If the word is 1 syllable long, then the consonants in the front switch with the consonants in the back. To make it easier to speak, useless words are removed and small changes to grammar are made. In the full version, small changes to letter sounds are made.

Example sentence 1:

E: I am going to the store.
K: Ki ma inggo ut adh orst.

or simply:

K: Ki og orst.

Example sentence 2:

E: He is so rude and annoying!
K: Ih zi os dur inda noiaing!

or simply:

K: Ih os dur noiaing!

## Words

Words are created by taking English words, transliterating them, and then applying the following cypher to them. Transliterating is writing the English word how it is pronounced, this step is important because many English words are written differently to how they are pronounced (through -> thru).

1. If the word is one syllable long, switch the consonant or consonant blend in the beginning with the consonant or consonant blend in the end. We keep the central vowel or diphthong (vowel blend) together. There is an exception to the consonant switching known as the *sticky rule* that makes it easier to do this transformation in your head. 
  a. Examples:
      i. cat -> kat -> tak
      ii. pot -> top
      iii. stem -> mest (consonant blend retains order, don't reverse the order of letters)
      iv. witch -> wich -> chiw

2. If the word is two or more syllables long, we switch syllable 1 with syllable 2, syllable 3 with syllable 4, and so on for however many syllables are in the word. If there is an odd number of syllables, such as in a three syllable word, you just leave the last syllable alone.
  a. Examples:
    i. seven -> vense
    ii. formula -> formyula -> myuforla
    iii. monopoly -> monapoli -> namolipo
    iv. action -> akshan -> shanak
    v. measure -> mezher -> zherme ("r" sticks to "e" because it's part of the vowel sound (sticky rule), will be explained later)

3. If the transformation results in an unpronounceable consonant cluster or an unpronounceable consonant in the beginning of a word (initial position) or in the end of a word (final position), we add a vowel to make it pronounceable. The rules are as follows.
  a. If the unpronouceable consonant(s) are in the initial position, we add an "i" to the beginning of the word
    i. and -> nda -> inda
    ii. imp -> mpi -> impi
    
  b. If the unpronouceable consonant(s) are in the final position, we add a "u" to the end of the word
    i. horse -> hors -> sorh -> sorhu ("r" sticks to "o" because it's part of the vowel sound (sticky rule))
    ii. work -> werk -> kerw -> kerwu (sticky rule)
  
  c. If the unpronouncable consonant cluster is inside the word (due to syllables shifting around), add an "i" to make it pronounceable.
    i. project -> projekt -> jektpro -> jektipro

### Sticky Rule
If I told you the rule was to switch the beginning consonants with the ending consonants of a word, and I gave you "street" (strit), your answer might be "trist". 
If I gave you "sweet" (swit), you would say "twis".
If I gave you "clear" (klir), you would say "lirk".
If I gave you "cute" (kyut), you would say "tyuk".
If I gave you "car" (kar), you would say "ark".

Why is this? Technically we should be moving the "r", "l", "y", and "w" as well! Technically, "street" -> "tistr", "sweet" -> "tisw", "clear" -> "rikl", "cute" -> "tuky", "car" -> "rak".

But this is not how our minds work, and also these words don't sound that great. We perceive "r", "l", "y", and "w" to be part of the vowel, and so it make sense to have a rule where we don't move these letter when they are effectively part of the vowel cluster. (The reason this happens is probably because in English, we have a retroflexive "r" and a dark "l" which both bleed into the vowel. "Y" and "w" are probably because they are technically semi-vowels). 

So, with the sticky rule, the more intuitive reversals become correct. 
1. street -> strit -> trist
2. clear -> klir -> lirk   -> rikl
3. cute -> kyut -> tyuk
4. car -> kar -> ark
5. calm -> kalm -> malk
6. helm -> melh -> melhu

Of course this only applies to single-syllable words; polysyllablic words are still transformed normally.
1. reverse -> revers -> versre
2. linear -> liniar -> niliar
3. security -> sekyuriti -> kyusetiri

There is an exception to the sticky rule; that is, when the r/l/y/w is an initial consonant outside of a blend (by itself).
1. rain -> rein -> neir
2. lane -> lein -> neil
3. yell -> yel -> ely -> elyu       -> lye

This is because, in these cases, the r/l/y/w



crash -> krash -> shrak
rash -> shar


chink -> nkchi -> inkchi
      -> nkich -> inkich

C1 V C2 --> C2 V C1
        --> C2 C1 V
